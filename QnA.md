What other data could you use to improve recommendations?
>

Assume a more real world situation where you could have more data you described above, and more time to implement, could you think of a possibly more efficient way to recommend?
>

Assume you have more than one implementation of recommendations, how could you test which one is more effective using data generated by user actions?
